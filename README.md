# Hello!

You've found my GitHub. Congratulations!

My completed (or nearly completed) projects will be public and viewable; however, my in-progress/unorganized work is still private until I get it cleaned up. Feel free to take a tour around my work if you're interested.

If desired, additional information can be found at www.maxdesantis.me.

Contact me at desantis.max.a@gmail.com or max.desantis@okstate.edu
